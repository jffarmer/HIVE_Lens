          <h3>See Science in a whole new way.</h3>

<p>Stemming from DEVELOP's long term Highly-portable Immersive Virtual Environment (HIVE) project, comes a new initiative, HIVE Lens. HIVE Lens aims to ramp up HIVE portability by going mobile. Using augmented reality and cellular operating systems, DEVELOP can serve up HIVE data to the screen that's with us always.</p>

<pre><code>public void satNetModis(View v){
     String url = "http://develop.larc.nasa.gov/";
     Intent browserIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url));
     startActivity(browserIntent);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>HIVE Lens will launch exclusively on Android with intention to start development on iOS and subsequent platforms before the year's end.</p>

<h3>View it with Vuforia AR</h3>

<p>Our app's augmented reality capability is built off of Qualcomm's Vuforia SDK. Vuforia is a software platform that uses top-notch, consistent, and technically resourceful computer vision-based image recognition and offers the widest set of features and capabilities, giving developers the freedom to extend their visions without technical limitations. With support for iOS, Android, and Unity 3D, the Vuforia platform allows you to write a single native app that can reach the most users across the widest range of smartphones and tablets.</p>

<h3>Sharing is Caring</h3>

<p>HIVE Lens will allow users to capture their augmented reality experiences and share them on a variety of social outlets, in addition to multimedia messaging, email, NFC, and bluetooth communication. The app will also supply a chat system for guests at DEVELOP venues. The chat will be implemented in a similar matter to IRC. </p>

<h3>Voice Control</h3>

<p>HIVE Lens will allow users to communicate with and orchestrate the application through voice. Additionally, the app will, in some cases, audibly speak information to the user, typically upon request.</p>
